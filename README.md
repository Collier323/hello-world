Hello anyone currently reading this, I hope you're having a wonderful day! My name's Collier, and I'm currently self studying Python, GIS, and as of this moment familiarizing myself with github. I graduated in May of 2020 with a degree in Geography and love learning new things! Avid hiker, reader, and video game junkie.
