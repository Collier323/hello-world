# hello-world
my first repo
Hello anybody reading this! My name is Collier and I'm currently studying Python and GIS. I graduated in May 2020 with a degree in Geography, and I love learning new things! As you can tell, I'm also familiarizing myself with GitHub, and plan to put all future projects(good or bad) here!
